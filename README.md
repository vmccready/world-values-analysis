Predictive Modeling with World Values Survey data. 

Differences in cultural values and beliefs can cause conflict between people. These conflicts can be as small as awkward moments and as large as multinational wars. The World Values Survey is an international research program devoted to the scientific study of social, political, economic, religious and cultural values of people in the word. Their main research is a survey conducted measuring beliefs and values throughout the world.

Using this data I hope to create statistical models to predict a person's country of residence. This model could be used as a tool for suggested compatability for travel, work, or living.
